# Indexer microservice

## API authentication

The indexer read API (`/api/v1/mints`, `/api/v1/transfers`, `/api/v1/burns`,
`/api/v1/stats`) is protected by a shared secret. Set it in the environment
(dotenv loads `.env` automatically) and send it on every request as a bearer
token:

```bash
# .env
INDEXER_API_TOKEN=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
```

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $INDEXER_API_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/v1/stats
```

Requests with a missing or incorrect token receive HTTP `401` with
`{ "error": "Unauthorized" }`. The token value is never logged. `GET /health`
is registered outside the authenticated router and stays public so uptime
probes keep working.

## Health/readiness probe

`GET /health` is a database readiness check. It runs a `SELECT 1` through the
shared Prisma client on every request:

- `200 { "status": "ok" }` — the database answered the ping.
- `503 { "status": "error" }` — the ping failed (wrong `DATABASE_URL`,
  database down, etc.). Hosting probes should treat this as unhealthy.

The route needs no bearer token. The response body is always a fixed literal,
so no driver error text, database URL, or credential can leak to the client;
failures are logged server-side with credentials scrubbed.
